### Custom Domain Binding

In case you are in need to put your online chat in production a [custom domain](https://docs.jelastic.com/custom-domains/) is obviuosly should be bound to it along with trusted SSL certificate generated. Keep in mind that the mobile applications are most strict with respect to certificate validity.
There are just few actions required to be conducted to ensure your application as production ready:
  1. Add a dedicated [load balancer](https://docs.jelastic.com/load-balancing/) with [public IP](https://docs.jelastic.com/public-ip/) address to you your environment in front of application node. Click on **[Change Environment Topology](https://docs.jelastic.com/setting-up-environment/)**.

</p>

From now on traffic will be directly routed to your environment's public IP address attached to the load balancer node. 

  2. Create an [A record](https://docs.jelastic.com/custom-domains/) at your domain registrar with a custom domain you prefer bound to public IP address attached to load balancer.
  
For example let's create A record for custom domain **my-online-chat.jele.website**.

  3. The last step is to issue a trusted SSL certificate for new custom domain. In Jelastic it may done with [Let's Encrypt SSL Add-On](https://jelastic.com/blog/free-ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt/) that can be found in the [Marketplace](https://docs.jelastic.com/marketplace/).

  4. Open your application by new URL: `https://my-online-chat.jele.website` and make sure the application is workable and traffic is encrypted with valid SSL certificate issued for custom domain.
